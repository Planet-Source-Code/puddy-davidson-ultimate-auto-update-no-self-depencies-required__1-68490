These are the server files required. some are optional, 1 is needed
you need also to upload the update exe to this same location


in the new version you only put the new version number in. so if your new v is 1.5 then just put 1.5 in the text doc, no spaces no nothing else

the exampleDisabled.txt you can leave blank, or put disabled in it to disable the program

the other txt docs you can fill with all the info you want, just remember it is going to be delivered in a messagebox (you can change this to a form if you like)
